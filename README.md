# SmartRoute - Indian Cities Optimizer & Dijkstra's Visualization  
 SmartRoute is a powerful web application that helps users find the shortest path between **Indian cities** using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**. It not only computes the optimal route but also provides an **interactive visualization** of how the algorithm works!  

---

##  Features  
**Route Optimization:** Quickly find the shortest path between two Indian cities.  
**Interactive Map:** The route is dynamically displayed using **Folium**.  
**Dijkstra’s Visualization:** Step-by-step animation of how the algorithm finds the shortest path.  
**Graph Representation:** A visual representation of cities and their connections.  
**Save & Load Graphs:** Store custom routes and reload them anytime.
